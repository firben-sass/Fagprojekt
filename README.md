# Data driven knots selection for functional data using Normalizing Flows

In order to be able to reproduce the results of the investigation, one must install all required packages with the correct versions, as state in the requirements txt file. This can be done by running the following command in the terminal:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
One can thereafter run the jupyter notebook, in order to firstly train the NF model and thereafter perform data driven knot selection:
```
main.ipynb
```
